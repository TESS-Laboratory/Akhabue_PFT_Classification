Repo for species classification into different PFT classes in JULES. The species data is from the TRY data base. I am using the categorical table available in JULES to do most of this classification (where available). 


To Do for this repo:
- Remove old files
- Add lookup table (csv file) (species ID Old and new, and four critical parameters, and JULES PFT classification)
- Add script for extracting TRY data from other repo
- Update readme (incl. one sentence explanation of each file)  
- Add a (short, ca. 1 sentnade decription in the description field for the repo.  
- Review retained scripts for comments that you do/dont want to share
- Make public, and push to Zenodo (Andy can help with this)
