family,Family name from WFO harmonization.
taxonID,WFO taxon identifier.
references,references from WFO taxonomic harmonization
sources,sources from WFO taxonomic harmonization
PlantGrowth_Source,Source/provenance for the PlantGrowthForm assignment. Values indicate whether the growth-form category was taken directly from the TRY categorical lookup table or derived via multi-source verification (see MULTI_AUTH).
LeafType_Source,Source/provenance for the LeafType assignment. Values as above.
LeafPhenology_Source,Source/provenance for the LeafPhenology assignment. Values as above.
PhotosyntheticPathway_Source,Source/provenance for the PhotosyntheticPathway assignment. Values as above.
ClimateZone_Source,Source/provenance for the ClimateZone assignment. Values as above.
,
MULTI_AUTH,"Parameter value assigned/verified using multiple authoritative sources, including databases and peer-reviewed literature listed in Table 2 of the manuscript (e.g., African Plant Database, World Flora Online, GBIF/iNaturalist where relevant, and publications cited in the reference list). Used when TRY categorical information was missing, incomplete, or ambiguous."
